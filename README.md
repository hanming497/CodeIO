# CODEIO: A React-based learning environment

CodeIO is a web application that allows users to better understand their own code. The primary use is intended for Students learning to code and having a hard time understanding ES6 syntax. CodeIO allows users to not only convert ES6 syntax to ES5/traditional functions but it also allows users to explain the code they are writing, and calculate time complexity of their code.

NPM install.
NPM run-script build.

in separate terminals: 
NPM start
Nodemon server

## Next Steps/Icebox features
1. Make App prettier. 
2. Deploy it online.
3. Complete code for relating users and previous searched/converted functions.
4. Implement way for users to be able to Convert between ES5 => ES6.
5. Add lessons/takeaways to site.
6. Implement way for teaching, with 1-2-4-7 method in mind.
7. Implement way for LEARNING, with 1-2-4-7 method in mind.
